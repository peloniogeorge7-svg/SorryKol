      <p><i>‎"Hi kol I just want to say sorry for ignoring you over the past 2 years. And that's not something I can ever take back. I super super truly regret it. I know things might be different now, but I hope you're doing well. I truly hope that you forgive me, But if not, I respect your decision, and I'll still be thankful that I was able to say sorry to you."</i></p>
